I maintain [modl](https://arthurmensch.github.io/modl), a package that proposes fast algorithms for sparse and dense matrix factorization, with a scikit-learn compatible API.

I maintain [cogspaces](https://cogspaces.github.io), a package that allows to do multi-study decoding in functional MRI. This new analysis approach uses brain-mind associations from many fMRI sources to extract functional networks relevant for mental state prediction.

I am a regular contributer to [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library, a widely used Python library for general machine learning.

I also contribute to [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io), a python library that leverages scikit-learn to perform analysis in neuro-imagery.
