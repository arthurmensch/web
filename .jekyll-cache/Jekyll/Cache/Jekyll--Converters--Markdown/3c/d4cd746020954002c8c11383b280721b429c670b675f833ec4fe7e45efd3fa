I"m<p>I am a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.com">DeepMind</a>, that I have joined at the end of 2020. I work in Paris office.</p>

<p>I was a post-doctoral research at École Normale Supérieure, Paris, in <a href="https://gpeyre.com">Gabriel Peyré</a>’s lab.
I hold a Ph.D. in machine learning, prepared in <a href="https://team.inria.fr/parietal/">Inria Parietal</a>, from 2015 to 2018.</p>

<p>I am currently interested in optimization and large-scale deep-learning, and continue to have interest for structured prediction, optimal transport and game theory.</p>

<p>My Ph.D. was obtained under the supervision of <a href="http://gael-varoquaux.info">Gaël Varoquaux</a>, <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/">Julien Mairal</a> and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/parietal/team-members/bertrand-thirions-page/">Bertrand Thirion</a>. I developed new stochastic algorithms and multi-task models for terabyte sized fMRI dataset analysis.</p>
