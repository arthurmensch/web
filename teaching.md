# 2017

## Deep learning (M2 Data Science - Polytechnique / Paris-Saclay)

- [Slides + Labs](https://github.com/m2dsupsdlclass/lectures-labs) of the course I was a TA for.
- I gave a [three notebook tutorial](https://github.com/m2dsupsdlclass/lectures-labs/tree/master/labs/08_frameworks) on [Pytorch](pytorch.org).

## Numerical analysis (ENSAE 1A)

- Python notebooks with (some) corrected exercices are available [in this repository](http://github.com/arthurmensch/numerical_analysis) -- either use git to check it out or download it as a zip file.
- I highly recommend looking at the Python notebooks from [Numerical Tours of Data Sciences](http://www.numerical-tours.com/) for those of you who want to dig further into optimization/data science/graphics. 
- [Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/) is an excellent resource for improving your skills in
    **numpy** and **matplotlib**, among other useful libraries for numerical analysis and data science.
- If you want to work from your laptop, I recommend that you install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your OS.
- If you do not like the spyder IDE, you should try directly working from Jupyter notebooks: you may prefer this workflow.
