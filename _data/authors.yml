                     I am a research scientist at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com), that I have joined at the end of 2020. I work in Paris office.


                     I was a post-doctoral research at École Normale Supérieure, Paris, in [Gabriel Peyré](https://gpeyre.com)'s lab.
                     I hold a Ph.D. in machine learning, prepared in [Inria Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/), from 2015 to 2018. 

                     I am currently interested in optimization and large-scale deep-learning, and continue to have interest for structured prediction, optimal transport and game theory.
                     
                     My Ph.D. was obtained under the supervision of [Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info), [Julien Mairal](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Bertrand Thirion](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/team-members/bertrand-thirions-page/). I developed new stochastic algorithms and multi-task models for terabyte sized fMRI dataset analysis.
                     
                     My detailed resume can be found [here](docs/cv.pdf). More details on my [research](research) and on [software](software).
