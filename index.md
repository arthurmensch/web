# Welcome

Welcome to my personal page. I use it to centralize useful personal info and to write posts related to my research. A list of my publications can be found here.

I am a Ph.D student at Inria Parietal group since September 2015. Before that, I studied science at the Ecole Polytechnique, and got specialized in applied mathematics and machine learning in Télécom ParisTech and ENS Cachan (master Maths-Vision-Apprentissage). Here is a detailed version of my CV.
